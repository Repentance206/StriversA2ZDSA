# strivers-a2zdsa-course
Starting to learn DSA with Striver's A2Z DSA Course/Sheet.
I am a beginner, so expect code written by a noob. Don't expect clean code and stuff which pro coders can do, but I am all ears if anyone have better ideas for improving my code.
I also expect that it will be a learning curve so message me if you have better ideas for learning to code.
In this repository, I will be following strivers-a2zdsa-sheet and strivers-a2zdsa-course youtube playlist step-by-step.
So, let's code and strive for success.
